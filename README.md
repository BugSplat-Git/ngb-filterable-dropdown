# ngb-filterable-dropdown
Powerful dropdown control for complicated filtering.

## Installation
`npm i -s @bugsplat/ngb-filterable-dropdown`

## Usage
Add NgbFilterableDropdownModule into your AppModules NgModule imports:
```ts
import { NgbFilterableDropdownModule } from '@bugsplat/ngb-filterable-dropdown'

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    NgbFilterableDropdownModule
  ],
  ...
})
```

The component takes two main inputs, a list of strings that are selectable and a sub-list of strings that are already selected. 
```ts
items: Array<string> = ['Beetle', 'Ant', 'Moth', 'Fire Ant', 'Dung Beetle', 'Grass Ant'];
selection: Array<string> = ['Moth'];
```

You can specify whether or not to allow new items to be created. By default, the component does not allow new items to be created.
```ts
allowCreateItem: boolean = false;
```

You can also specify whether or not to allow multiple items to be selected. By default, the component allows one item to be selected.
```ts
allowMultiSelect: boolean = false;
```

Additional inputs are provided for further dropdown customization. Auto close can be set to true or false; alternatively you can specify whether to close on an outside or inside click. Dropdowns may also be disabled at any time.
```ts
autoClose: boolean | 'inside' | 'outside' = false;
disabled: boolean = false;
loading: boolean = false;
placeholder: string = 'No Items Selected';
```

The component provides the selected data back to the parent through the selectionChanged event.
```ts
onSelectionChanged(event: SelectionChangedEvent) {
  const selection = event.selection;
}
```

When an item is created the component outputs an event with the properties created, items, and selection.
```ts
onItemCreated(event: ItemCreatedEvent) {
  const created = event.created;
  const selection = event.selection;
  const items = event.items;
}
```

The component also provides an event when the dropdown is opened or closed through the openChanged event.
```ts
onOpenChanged(event: OpenChangedEvent) {
  const open = event.open;
}
```

Add ngb-filterable-dropdown to your component's template:
```html
<ngb-filterable-dropdown [allowCreateItem]="allowCreateItem" 
  [allowMultiSelect]="allowMultiSelect" [autoClose]="autoClose"
  [disabled]="disabled" [loading]="loading"
  [items]="items" [selection]="selection"
  (itemCreated)="onItemCreated($event)" (openChanged)="onOpenChanged($event)"
  (selectionChanged)="onSelectionChanged($event)" >
</ngb-filterable-dropdown>
```
