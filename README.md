# animated-counter

Powerful dropdown control for complicated filtering.

## Installation

`npm i --s @bugsplat/ng-filterable-dropdown`

## Usage
Import FilterableDropdownModule into NgModule imports:
```js
import { FilterableDropdownModule } from '@bugsplat/ng-filterable-dropdown'

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    FilterableDropdownModule
  ],
  ...
```
The component takes two main inputs, a list of strings that are selectable and a sub-list of strings that are already selected. 
```js
  readonly bugs: Array<string> = ['Beetle', 'Ant', 'Moth', 'Fire Ant', 'Dung Beetle', 'Grass Ant'] 
  selected: Array<string> = ['Moth'];
```
You can specify whether or not to allow multiple items to be selected. By default, the component allows one item to be selected.
```js
  allowMultiSelect: boolean = false;
```
Additional inputs are provided for further dropdown customization. Auto close can be set to true or false; alternatively you can specify whether to close on an outside or inside click. Dropdowns may also be disabled at any time.
```js
  autoClose: boolean | 'inside' | 'outside' = false;
  disabled: boolean = false;
```
Add the counter to your component's template:

```html
<ng-filterable-dropdown [params]="params"></ng-filterable-dropdown>
```	```

## Compatability
Animated counter is built using Angular`>=6.0.0`.
